They were very easy to work with from the design stage up until the day I received the finished piece(s). Their design team is incredible! I would tell them what I envisioned in my head, and they would draw it up so that I could actually see how it was going to look before they made it. The quality and workmanship of everything is top notch.  I have had their pieces in commercial settings for years with no signs of needing repair, and I continue to get asked the question "where did you get that"?  I would highly recommend Knot 2 Rustic to anyone who is looking for something unique, beautiful, durable and a piece that you will enjoy for many years!"</p>
